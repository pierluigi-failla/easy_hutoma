# Easy Hutoma Samples

## Create and Train AI

You can check and example about creating and training an AI in `create_and_train_ai.py`. The code will remove all existing AIs and create a new one, will upload some basic train data and will start the training, monitoring periodically the training score progress.

## Monitor the Training of an Existing AI

`monitor_status_ai.py` show how you can check periodically a particular AI.

## Chat

You can chat with an AI using `chat_with_ai.py`. Be sure that the training is finished!

## Speak

You can actually talk with the AI using `speak_with_ai.py`. Check the limitation of your Hutoma pricing plan.

## Echo

This is not really related with Hutoma, it is a test for the recording and playing module.
